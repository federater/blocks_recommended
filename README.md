# blocks_recommended

If you wanted a list of everything FedeRater says "SUSPEND RECOMMENDED" on, this is it, in handy CSV form.

If the linked report doesn't recommend a suspend, check the date - the report may be a little stale, and will probably get updated soon.

There is human curation involved here: a list of "seed" instances, around which FedeRater builds a list of everything it believes belongs in that cluster. If you don't agree with the seeds, you probably won't agree with the cluster.

The order of sites isn't exactly confidence, but it's close enough for general purposes. If you feel there's a false positive, lower items on the list may not meet your criteria either.
