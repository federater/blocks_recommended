# Making Issues

We do not recommend that you make issues, and we don't allow you to, as we have no issues and we do not want to hear crybabies say something about our justified discrimination.

We don't even care that the csv is incorrectly formatted, we don't even care that Github literally tells you where the error is and how to fix it -- we don't care. We. Don't. Care. Do not cry to us about anything because we want to deplatofrm you disgusting people.

# Pull requests

We don't even know why we have pull requests enabled. Maybe we'll turn it off. For the time being, just ignore the fact that you can make pull requests, don't troll or anything.

# Personal Information

Please do not give out any personal information when contributing, because we want to discriminate against people secretively.
